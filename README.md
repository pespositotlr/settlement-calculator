# Settlement Calculator

## Overview

This project was part of a coding challenge to build a full stack application to function as a settlement calculator.

The front-end is written in Angular and the back-end is written in .NET Core. 

The goal is to allow a user to input an amount of money and then show what payments they would make splitting it up into a pre-set number of weeks (set on the back-end). Then output the result in a form showing the dates and the price.

It's meant to have thorough unit tests on the back end and use clean-coding and SOLID design principles to allow every part of it to be easy to understand and extend as requirements change.

The front-end had requirements to have navigation, an input form with validation, and a separate URI for the user to be sent to when they submit their payment amount.
